This tool is designed to create, generate, and manage characters for the Pulp RPG system (also designed by me).

Rules for the system are as follows:

Welcome to Pulp, a rules-light, fully-agnostic RPG system.
Pulp aims to be an extremely simple system that takes only minutes to learn and create characters in.
It is mainly designed for high-action, low-content one-shots.

Character Creation:

Each character and NPC has two major components: Energy and Powers.
Powers are the actions a character can take during their turn.
Energy can be thought of as a combination of HP and mana.
It costs energy to use a power.

The energy a character starts with is based on their level.
Characters' levels can increase as the GM sees fit.
The amount of energy a character starts with is their level x5 +20

Each character (with the possible exception of powerful NPCs) has a maximum of five powers.
A character does not have to use all five of these slots.
Each power has four major components: energy cost, potential, effects, and a description.
The energy cost of a power is subtracted from the character's energy whenever the character uses that power.
Energy cost is based on the power's potential.
Potential is a measure of how strong the power is.
Each power's potential is subtracted directly from the character's starting energy upon character creation.
Effects determine what the power does.
Each power has between 1 and 5 effects.
A single power cannot have more than one of the same effect.
Each of these effects has a value, eg, the amount of damage dome to a target.
The effect's value increases the amount of potential required to create the power.
The power's description determines how the power funtions.
The decription is created by the player and approved by the GM.

Characters also can have names and epithets.
Epithets descibe the playstyle, job, or type of character.

Combat:

Combat in Pulp is turn-based.
The characters on each team in combat use powers as they wish.


Each side of combat turn at the same time
can act in any order, coming back to characters
powers only used once per turn


When a character's energy drops to zero, they are knocked out and cannot act for their next turn.
If, by the beginning of their next turn, their energy remains at zero, the character dies.

Non-important enemies can die as soon as their energy reaches zero, if the GM so wishes.
